This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/NYU/02_Module/08_DMR/Assignment01")
plot(cars)

library(DMwR)

#head means to give you the top rows of the data set. complete.cases is a function in R that finds NA's in any column in your dataset and 3 just means the top 3 rows.
head(ins[!complete.cases(ins),],3)

nrow(ins[!complete.cases(ins),])

mode(ins$normLoss)

summary(ins$normLoss)

#here we filled in the na's with the median values. centraliputation basically is the median
noNA.ins <- centralImputation(ins) 

#here we used the weighted average of the nearest neighbors to get a value for the na's
noNA.ins <- knnImputation(ins,k=10)

summary(ins$normLoss)

```

```{r}
norm.ins <- ins

#here he is normalizing the values in columns 10 through 14 , column 17 ,19,26 which all happen to be numerical
#here we are  column values are divided by the columnâ€™s standard deviation
#so basically we get the z score of the individual data points and use it to normalize the columns
for(var in c(10:14,17,19:26)) 
  norm.ins[,var] <- scale(ins[,var])

mean(ins$curbWeight)
# 520.6802   /2548
# 
# (2548-2555.566)/520.6802 

```
```{r}
#this original way he did this over wrote the original column so if I wanted to cut the data a different way I would have to re-ingest. best thing to do is make a new column.
data(Boston, package="MASS") 
Boston$age2 <- cut(Boston$age,4)
table(Boston$age2)
```

```{r}
#data(Boston, package="MASS") 
Boston$age3 <- cut(Boston$age,quantile(Boston$age,probs=seq(0, 1, .25)))
table(Boston$age3)

boxplot(Boston$age)
hist(Boston$age)
```
