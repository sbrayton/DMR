# Data Gathering
For this assignment my team and I decided to use the wisconsin breast cancer research data found on the UCI website.  
- To begin the process, we pulled the data directly from the URL into a data frame.  
- Then we replaced the column headers wich were not included in the data, but we were able to pull from the data dictionary made available by the UCI site.
```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#loading the necessary library
library(data.table)

# pulling the data straight from the online site
mydat <- fread('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data')

# altering the column names of my dataframe to match the data dictionary that was found online

names(mydat) <- c("patientID", "clump_thicknes","uniformity_cell_size","uniformity_cell_shape","marginal_adhesion","single_eipthelial","bare_nuclei","bland_chromatin","normal_nucleoli","mitoses","class")


```
