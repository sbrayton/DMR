# Data Gathering
For this assignment my team and I decided to use the wisconsin breast cancer research data found on the UCI website.  
- To begin the process, we pulled the data directly from the URL into a data frame.  
- Then we replaced the column headers wich were not included in the data, but we were able to pull from the data dictionary made available by the UCI site.
```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#loading the necessary library
library(data.table)

# pulling the data straight from the online site
mydat <- fread('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data')

# altering the column names of my dataframe to match the data dictionary that was found online

names(mydat) <- c("patientID", "clump_thicknes","uniformity_cell_size","uniformity_cell_shape","marginal_adhesion","single_eipthelial","bare_nuclei","bland_chromatin","normal_nucleoli","mitoses","class")


```
#Data Cleansing
```{r  include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

library(readr)
# here I want to replace an ? marks found in my data with na so that I can use R functions/packages to clean them up.
na.mydat <- parse_integer(mydat$bare_nuclei,na="?")

#Once I have made the ? na I want to add the vector back to my data frame
mydat$bare_nuclei<-na.mydat
noNA.mydat <- centralImputation(mydat) 

```
here we had to normalize `r nrow(mydat[!complete.cases(mydat),])` rows of data that contained NA's
by using the DMwR2 funciton "centralImputation" we were able to use the median to fill in for the NA entries within our dataset.
```{r echo=FALSE}

#here we will use knitr to produce a html friendly table to display the top 3 rows of na data examples.
library(knitr)
kable( head(mydat[!complete.cases(mydat),],3), caption = 'Top 3 Rows with Missing Data')

#I think I can consolidate the next two steps, but basically I am getting the rows we showed of unclean data and filtering the cleansed data table with the same rows.
t<-head(mydat[!complete.cases(mydat),],3)

pIDvector <-t$patientID

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable( noNA.mydat[noNA.mydat$patientID %in% pIDvector, ], caption = 'Same 3 rows, with NA\'s cleansed')
```

```{r}


```
